# Agent Notes

- `codeql-noarchive` in this repo currently scans `actions` and `javascript-typescript` only.
- If Python source files are added outside `archive/`, update `.github/workflows/codeql-noarchive.yml` to include `python` in the language matrix.

## Backup Policy

- The Phase B observations backup is mandatory in this project.
- Never suggest disabling, skipping, or reducing Phase B backup coverage to lower egress or cost.
- Egress optimizations must preserve full backup integrity and intended backup behavior.
